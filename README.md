# Project_2_Credit_Default
Authors:  Erik Redman,Esha Sharma, Marwen Boughanmi,Jesse Poljak
# Project Overview:
Our project purpose is to predict the likelihood of a credit card holder defaulting on their payment next month using historical data. We first conducted thorough data preprocessing, built optimized machine learning models, and evaluated their performance using key metrics. Using this approach, we were able to get insight on proactive credit risk management.

# Research Questions:
1-Based on historical data, can we predict whether someone will default?
2-How does the performance of a Random Forest model compare to Logistic Regression for predicting credit card defaults?
3-How to optimize the model to predict credit card defaults
4-How does the bill amount relate to the pay - if the amount is too high more the chance of default?
